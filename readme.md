INSTRUCTIONS:
There are 4 tasks below, in your cloned repo, try to complete them one by one, do not progress to the next task without finishing the previous. Try to write good comments for your changes. DO NOT commit your changes to a publically viewable github repository.

Once you've done as much as you can, zip up the whole folder and send it via email to pamela@kamiapp.com

You have one week to do as much as you can, it's due by Tuesday night 11:59pm 31th August 2021.

DO NOT ask your friends to help you or post this online, you will be given a live test for the second round interview so there is no point.
Any other questions you have regarding the test tasks or submission method please feel free to email pamela@kamiapp.com as well.

TASKS:

1. when the snake intercepts itself the game doesn't end, fix this. Note: the "restart game" button doesn't fully work at this point so to test just refresh the page.

2. There is a bug when you click the "restart game" button while the first game is still in progress, fix this, end the previous game when ever the user clicks "restart game". There is currently a memory leak whenever the game is restarted, think through if everything is actually stopped or not when doing this fix.

3. the game speed variable doesn't work, fix this, the speed the snake moves should increase and decrease based on the numerical value the user inputs into the Gamespeed number box. The scale of this number and it's impact on the speed is up to you, as long as it does change the speed.

4. when the snake just happens to go over the grid prior to it's tail, there is a bug that renders that grid white going forward. Fix this.
